# Company Setup for Makhana Export Business in India

## Business Structure Options

When starting a makhana export business in India, selecting the right business structure is crucial as it affects taxation, liability, regulatory compliance, and operational flexibility. Based on the latest 2025 guidelines, here are the main business structures available:

### Sole Proprietorship
The simplest form of business structure where a single individual owns and operates the business. While it offers complete control and minimal regulatory requirements, the owner bears unlimited personal liability for all business debts and obligations. For small-scale makhana export operations with limited initial investment, this structure might be suitable for testing the market before scaling up.

### Partnership Firm
A business owned by two or more individuals who share profits, losses, and liabilities according to their partnership agreement. Traditional partnership firms offer operational flexibility but expose partners to unlimited liability. This structure works well when combining complementary skills and resources from multiple stakeholders in the makhana value chain.

### Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
An LLP combines the flexibility of a partnership with the limited liability protection of a company. Partners' liability is limited to their agreed contribution, protecting personal assets. As of 2025, LLPs have become increasingly popular for export businesses due to their favorable tax treatment and reduced compliance burden compared to private limited companies.

### Private Limited Company
A separate legal entity owned by shareholders with liability limited to their investment. This structure offers the strongest protection of personal assets and is highly regarded by international buyers and financial institutions. For medium to large-scale makhana export operations with significant capital investment and growth plans, a private limited company provides the most professional image and access to funding opportunities.

### Public Limited Company
Similar to a private limited company but with the ability to offer shares to the public. This structure is typically suitable for large-scale operations with substantial capital requirements and is generally not recommended for new makhana export ventures.

## Registration Process and Documentation

### Business Registration

1. **Business Name Registration**: Register your business name with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) for companies or with the relevant local authority for proprietorships and partnerships.

2. **Certificate of Incorporation**: For companies and LLPs, obtain a Certificate of Incorporation from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs through the MCA21 portal.

3. **Partnership Deed**: For partnership firms, create and register a partnership deed with the Registrar of Firms in your state.

4. **Business PAN Card**: Obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN) for your business entity from the Income Tax Department. This is mandatory for all import-export transactions and serves as documentation of authority for imports and exports.

5. **Company Registration with ROC**: Register your business with the Registrar of Companies after finalizing your business structure. Each state has a distinct registration procedure.

### Export-Specific Registrations

1. **Import Export Code (IEC)**: The DGFT (Director General of Foreign Trade) issues the 10-digit IEC code, which is valid for life and essential for all export-import activities. As of 2025, the IEC application must be submitted online through the DGFT portal with supporting documentation including PAN, Aadhaar, business proof, and bank details.

2. **Business Identification Number (BIN)**: Obtain a BIN from the Customs Department as the first step in export documentation. All firm-related information will carry this number.

3. **Certificate of Registration from DGFT**: After business registration, obtain a Certificate of Registration from the DGFT. This certificate allows entry and exit from the country without paying customs fees.

4. **RBI License**: If you plan to trade in foreign exchange, an RBI license is required.

5. **GST Registration**: Register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) through the GST portal. For export businesses, this is particularly important as it allows for claiming input tax credits and zero-rated exports.

## Banking and Financial Setup

1. **Business Bank Account**: Open a dedicated business bank account for your export operations. The documentation required varies based on your business structure, with more extensive paperwork needed for companies compared to sole proprietorships.

2. **FIRC (Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate)**: Arrange with your bank to provide FIRCs for all export payments received, as these are essential for claiming export incentives and tax benefits.

3. **Letter of Credit Facility**: Establish a relationship with a bank that offers Letter of Credit facilities, which are crucial for international trade transactions.

## Government Initiatives Supporting Makhana Export (2025)

### Makhana Board

The Board has received an initial allocation of INR 100 crore (USD 11.55 million) to support these initiatives.

Makhana has been identified as a priority product in Bihar under the ODOP scheme, which provides:

- Assistance with export documentation and compliance
- Facilitation of organic and fair trade certifications
- Market intelligence and export promotion activities

### National Horticulture Mission (NHM)
The NHM supports makhana cultivation through:

## Compliance and Quality Standards

1. **Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)**: Obtain FSSAI registration or license depending on the scale of operations.

2. **Export Inspection Council (EIC) Certification**: For food products like makhana, EIC certification may be required by certain importing countries.

3. **Organic Certification**: If planning to export organic makhana, certification from APEDA-accredited agencies is necessary.

4. **Geographical Indication (GI) Compliance**: Bihar's makhana received GI status in 2022, which adds value to exports but requires adherence to specific quality parameters.

5. **International Standards**: Depending on target markets, compliance with standards such as ISO 22000, HACCP, BRC, or GLOBAL G.A.P. may be necessary.

## Recommended Business Structure for Makhana Export

For a new makhana export business in 2025, a **Private Limited Company** is generally the most advantageous structure due to:

1. **Limited Liability Protection**: Shields personal assets from business risks, which is crucial in international trade
2. **Credibility with International Buyers**: Presents a professional image to foreign clients and partners
3. **Access to Funding**: Easier to attract investors and secure bank loans
4. **Tax Benefits**: Eligible for various export incentives and corporate tax benefits
5. **Scalability**: Supports business growth through additional share issuance
6. **Perpetual Existence**: Continues regardless of changes in ownership

However, for very small operations or testing phases, an LLP might be more suitable due to lower compliance requirements while still offering limited liability protection.

## Conclusion

Setting up a makhana export business in India requires careful planning and compliance with various regulatory requirements. The 2025 establishment of the Makhana Board and other government initiatives provide significant support for new entrants in this sector. By choosing the appropriate business structure and completing all necessary registrations, a makhana export business can position itself for success in the growing global market for this nutritious superfood.
