# Makhana Quality Parameters and Grading Systems

## Introduction to Makhana Quality Standards

Makhana (fox nuts or lotus seeds) quality assessment is a critical component of the export value chain, directly impacting market acceptance, pricing, and regulatory compliance. As global demand for this nutritious superfood continues to grow, standardized quality parameters have become increasingly important for international trade.

The quality of makhana is determined by several key factors including size, color, expansion quality, moisture content, and the presence of impurities or defects. While traditional assessment methods relied heavily on visual inspection and manual sorting, modern export standards now incorporate precise measurements and scientific testing to ensure consistency and meet international food safety requirements.

This comprehensive analysis examines the established quality parameters, grading systems, and assessment methodologies used in the makhana industry as of 2025, with a particular focus on export-oriented standards.

## Key Quality Parameters for Makhana

### 1. Size and Diameter

Size is the most fundamental quality parameter for makhana and serves as the primary basis for grading and pricing. In the traditional Indian system, makhana size is measured using a unit called "Soota" (also spelled "Sutta").

#### Understanding the Soota Measurement System:

- 1 Foot = 12 Inches
- 1 Inch = 8 Soota
- 1 Inch = 25.4mm
- 1 Soota = 3.175mm

Based on this measurement system, makhana is classified into different size categories:

| Size Category | Diameter Range (mm) | Soota Classification | Export Grade |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Premium       | ≥19mm              | 6+ Soota            | Super Premium |
| Large         | 15.8mm - 19mm      | 5 Soota             | Premium |
| Medium        | 12.7mm - 15.8mm    | 4 Soota             | Standard |
| Small         | 9.5mm - 12.7mm     | 3 Soota             | Economy |
| Very Small    | <9.5mm             | <3 Soota            | Not suitable for export |

For export markets, the size consistency within a batch is as important as the average size. High-quality export batches should have a size variation of less than 10% to ensure uniform appearance and cooking properties.

### 2. Color and Appearance

The color of makhana is a critical quality indicator that significantly impacts market value and consumer acceptance. The ideal color characteristics include:

#### Color Grading Scale:

| Grade | Color Description | Export Suitability |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Grade 1 | Creamy white with no discoloration | Ideal for premium export markets |
| Grade 2 | Creamy white with minimal light reddish spots | Suitable for standard export |
| Grade 3 | White with noticeable reddish spots | Limited export potential |
| Grade 4 | Yellowish or brownish tint | Not suitable for export |

The presence of reddish or brown spots on makhana is typically caused by:
- Delayed harvesting
- Improper drying techniques
- Exposure to moisture during storage
- Microbial contamination
- Age-related oxidation

For export quality, makhana should have a uniform, bright white appearance with minimal spotting. Premium markets in the USA, UK, and UAE particularly value the aesthetic appeal of spotless, white makhana.

### 3. Expansion Quality and Texture
![](https://github.com/tarunk04/makhana-export-business-plan/blob/main/makhana_export_business/makhana_expansion_quality.png)

The expansion quality refers to how well the makhana has "popped" or puffed during processing. This parameter affects both the visual appeal and the textural experience of the product.

#### Expansion Quality Categories:

| Category | Description | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fully Expanded | Perfectly puffed with spherical shape | Ideal for premium export |
| Partially Expanded | Mostly puffed but with some irregularities | Acceptable for standard export |
| Flattened | Inadequately puffed, appears compressed | Not suitable for export |
| Irregular | Misshapen or broken pieces | Not suitable for export |

The expansion quality is directly related to:
- The maturity of the harvested seeds
- The moisture content at the time of processing
- The processing technique and temperature control
- The skill of the processor

For export markets, only fully expanded or high-quality partially expanded makhana should be selected. The texture should be crisp and light, with a satisfying crunch when bitten.

### 4. Moisture Content

Moisture content is a critical parameter that affects both the shelf life and the textural properties of makhana. Proper moisture control is essential for preventing microbial growth and maintaining crispness.

#### Moisture Content Standards:

| Grade | Moisture Content | Shelf Life | Export Suitability |
|-------|------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Premium | 8-10% | 12-18 months | Ideal for export |
| Standard | 10-12% | 6-12 months | Acceptable for export with proper packaging |
| Substandard | >12% | <6 months | Not suitable for export |

For export markets, moisture content should be scientifically measured using calibrated moisture meters rather than relying on traditional tactile assessment methods. Packaging technologies such as vacuum sealing or nitrogen flushing can help maintain optimal moisture levels during international shipping.

### 5. Impurities and Foreign Matter

The presence of impurities significantly impacts food safety and regulatory compliance, particularly for international markets.

#### Impurity Tolerance Levels:

| Type of Impurity | Premium Export Grade | Standard Export Grade | Domestic Grade |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Visible foreign matter | <0.1% | <0.5% | <1.0% |
| Insect damage | None | <0.2% | <0.5% |
| Broken pieces | <2% | <5% | <10% |
| Immature seeds | <1% | <3% | <5% |

For export markets, particularly to countries with stringent food safety regulations like the USA, EU, and Australia, comprehensive testing for:
- Pesticide residues (below 0.01 mg/kg for most pesticides)
- Heavy metals (lead <0.2 mg/kg, cadmium <0.1 mg/kg)
- Microbial contamination (total plate count <10,000 CFU/g)
- Aflatoxins (<4 ppb for total aflatoxins)

### 6. Nutritional Profile

While not traditionally part of the grading system, the nutritional profile of makhana is increasingly important for export markets, particularly for health-conscious consumers in developed countries.

#### Key Nutritional Parameters:

| Nutrient | Premium Quality | Standard Quality |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Protein | 9-10% | 7-9% |
| Carbohydrates | 76-80% | 70-76% |
| Fat | <0.5% | <1.0% |
| Dietary Fiber | >2.5% | >2.0% |
| Potassium | >500 mg/100g | >400 mg/100g |
| Magnesium | >90 mg/100g | >70 mg/100g |
| Phosphorus | >65 mg/100g | >50 mg/100g |

Export markets increasingly require nutritional analysis certificates, particularly for products marketed as superfoods or health foods.

## Standardized Grading Systems

### 1. Traditional Indian Grading System

The traditional Indian grading system for makhana has evolved over generations and is still widely used in domestic markets. This system primarily focuses on size, color, and expansion quality.

#### Traditional Grades:

| Grade 2 | Murra | Medium-large size (4-5 Soota), white with minimal spots, fully expanded | Standard export and quality domestic market |
| Grade 3 | Thurri | Small size (3-4 Soota), white with some spots, fully expanded | Domestic market and processing |
| Grade 4 | Chipta | Any size, flattened or partially expanded | Processing for flour and other derivatives |
| Grade 5 | Kutta | Broken pieces, irregular shapes, discolored | Animal feed and industrial use |

While this traditional system remains relevant for domestic trade, it lacks the precision and standardization required for international markets.

### 2. AGMARK Standards (India)

The Agricultural Marketing (AGMARK) standards developed by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI) in India provide a more formalized grading system for makhana. These standards are particularly important for export certification.

#### AGMARK Grades for Makhana:

| Grade | Size Specification | Color | Moisture | Foreign Matter | Broken/Damaged |
|-------|-------------------|-------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Special | ≥15mm diameter | Creamy white | ≤10% | ≤0.1% | ≤2% |
| Standard | ≥12mm diameter | White with minimal spots | ≤12% | ≤0.5% | ≤5% |
| General | ≥9mm diameter | White with some spots | ≤14% | ≤1.0% | ≤10% |

AGMARK certification is increasingly important for accessing premium export markets and provides a standardized quality assurance mechanism recognized by international buyers.

### 3. Export Quality Standards (2025)
